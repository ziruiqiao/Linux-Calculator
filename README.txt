1. In linux terminal type "gcc client.c -o c" to compile client.c
2. type "gcc server.c -o s" to compile server.c
3. type "./s" to run server.c on a terminal
4. Open another tab of terminal
5. type "./c" on the new terminal to run client.c

you are now running the program.

Input commands and get responses on client
The commands include: (x represents any number)
1. Insert(x)
2. Delete(x)
3. Average
4. Median
5. Sum
6. Min
7. end (will terminate the program)

you can see on server that how long it takes a command to run.
Once all commands from 1 to 6 are used at least once, the server
will calculate the average time of running and print it out.
